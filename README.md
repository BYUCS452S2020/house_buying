# house_buying
A way to have all the houses that you're currently looking at in one place. 

# Description
As soon as the term ends a few of you (including myself) will be graduated and moving on with life. Perhaps you will literally be moving to a new location. Finding a possibly permanent place to live can be a daunting task but hopefully this app will help people to be able to compare all the places they're looking at. 

# Team
I'm looking for two or more others to join the team.

# SQL
I'm a noob when it comes to SQL so I'm open to suggestions. 

# No-SQL
I think that the document database will work well for this project because although living accomodations share a lot in common there can be large differences to them (apartment, condo, duplex, house, etc)

# Business
Users will be able to have all of the places they're looking at with a ranking system based on their own scores. 
They'll be able to look at pictures of the places they're looking at.
They will be able to see one other people's favorite places and their rankings (for people who want to find a place to live with a roommate or a spouse)

# Legal
This will be very illegal. I don't know how yet but it will.

# Technical
Our priorities will be:

A user friendly way to see options
Choose an initial SQL database for a prototype
Choose both client-side and server-side programming languages
