# Docker file to easily set up the MySQL server

**For linux users**
Go to the directory that the docker-compose file is in. Type in this command:

	sudo docker-compose up -d
  
To turn off the server do this:

	sudo docker-compose down

Sorry I have no idea. Probably pretty similar to Linux

** For Windows users**
Good luck idk.
